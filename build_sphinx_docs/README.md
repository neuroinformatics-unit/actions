# Build Sphinx documentation action
This is a GitHub action that builds Sphinx documentation for your project.

The various steps include:

* setting up Python
  * the version can be specified via the `python-version` input, and defaults to `3.x`
* installing pip and setting up pip cache
* pip installing build dependencies (themes, build tools, etc.) from `docs/requirements.txt`
* checking that external links in the documentation are not broken 
  * optional, defaults to `true` (i.e. links are checked), see the [warning](#warning) below for more information
* building the html pages in one of two ways, by setting the `use-make` input (default: `false`)
  * (default) using `sphinx-build` to build the pages from `docs/source` (should contain Sphinx source files) to `docs/build`
  * (`use-make: true`) using the `make` utility with a custom `docs/Makefile` to build the pages from `SOURCEDIR` to `BUILDDIR` as defined in the Makefile
* uploading the built html pages as an artifact named `docs-build`, for use in other actions
  * by default, the artifact is uploaded using [actions/upload-artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact)
  * alternatively, if the [artifact.ci](artifact.ci) GitHub app is installed in your repository,
    you can upload the artifact using artifact.ci by setting the `use-artifactci` input to `true` (default: `false`). 
    This will upload the artifact to a public URL on which the docs can be previewed.
    The URL to the preview is printed to the GitHub Actions summary.

It can be run upon all pull requests, to ensure that documentation still builds.

It does not publish or deploy the documentation in any way (for that, check the [Deploy Sphinx Docs action](../deploy_sphinx_docs/README.md)).

## Warning

You can debug the linkcheck step by running it locally:
```bash
sphinx-build docs/source docs/build -b linkcheck
```
or, if you have `docs/Makefile`:
```bash
cd docs && make linkcheck
```
If the linkcheck step produces "false positives" for your project (i.e. marking valid links as broken), you have two options:

- Adding the following to `conf.py` (replace with the problematic URLs).
  ```python
  # The linkcheck builder will skip verifying that anchors exist when checking 
  # these URLs (e.g. because they are generated by JavaScript).
  linkcheck_anchors_ignore_for_url = [
      "https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/",
      "https://neuroinformatics.zulipchat.com/",
  ]
  ```
- Disabling the linkcheck step by setting the `check-links` input to `false`, e.g.:
  ```yaml
  build_sphinx_docs:
    name: Build Sphinx Docs
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: neuroinformatics-unit/actions/build_sphinx_docs@main
      with:
        check-links: false
  ```
